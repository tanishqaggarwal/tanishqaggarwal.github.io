                    headed by Dr. Mason Peck, PAN will launch two CubeSats into space on
                    differing orbits and attempt to have them autonomously dock with one another. This project is the
                    first
                    known project to be attempting fully autonomous spacecraft rendezvous and docking manuevers in
                    space.

                <p>I was scheduled to be the team lead of this project in Fall 2018. Unfortunately, due to funding and

                    constraints, this project was cancelled. While the team was still in existence, I was in charge of

                <p>As co-president of my high school's science club, I captained our team to a 10th place finish at the
                    2017
                    National Science Bowl in Washington, D.C., and co-captained our team to qualify for the National
                    Science
                    Olympiad. I was also a team member of our National Ocean Sciences Bowl team, which also finished in
                    10th
                    place nationally.</p>
                <p>In addition, I competed in individual science competitions as well, becoming a semifinalist in the
                    USA Biology
                    Olympiad and the USA Astronomy and Astrophysics Olympiad.</p>

                <h4>West Windsor-Plainsboro Mathematics Tournament</h4>
                <p>I helped found this math tournament for 3rd-8th graders that attracts nearly 500 students annually
                    from the
                    surrounding tri-state area. From 2013-2017, I played a key role in planning and organizing this
                    event.
                    I was also responsible for developing its
                    <a href="https://wwpmt.org" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
                <p>As elected secretary of my high school's math club, I was also responsible for coordinating

                    between the administration, the club advisor, and our club.</p>

                <h4>Hackathon Projects</h4>
                <p>In high school and college I competed in several hackthons, such as PennApps, HackRPI, HackRU, and
                    BigRedHacks.
                    Through hackathons I developed experience in areas such as electrical engineering, computer vision,
                    and
                    mobile app development.</p>
                <p>During PennApps 2016, my partner Kevin Li and I developed an app called EarLens, a hearing assistance
                    app,
                    that was recognized as a semifinalist (top 15) at the competition. This was among nearly 2000
                    participants,
                    of mostly college age, while I was a high school junior.</p>

                <h4>Capture the Flag Tournaments (CTFs)</h4>
                <p>From 2014-2016, I was the captain of my high school's CTF competition team, Algorithmic Armadillos.
                    CTFs
                    are information security/hacking competitions where the objective is to obtain a string, called a
                    flag,
                    by cracking into cryptographic schemes or programs or websites. The team that collects the most
                    number
                    of strings out of a series of uniquely designed challenges wins the CTF tournament.</p>
                <p>Our team placed well in several nationwide competitions, such as 3rd place in
                    <a href="http://hsctf.io" target="_blank">HSCTF</a> 2015 and 2nd place in
                    <a href="http://sctf.io" target="_blank">sCTF</a> 2014.</p>
