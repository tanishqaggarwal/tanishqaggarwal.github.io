                <h4>Pathfinding Autonomous Navigation (PAN)</h4>
                <p>A project under the
                    <a href="http://spacecraftresearch.squarespace.com" target="_blank">Space Systems Design Studio</a> headed by Dr. Mason Peck, PAN will launch two CubeSats into space on
                    differing orbits and attempt to have them autonomously dock with one another. This project is the first
                    known project to be attempting fully autonomous spacecraft rendezvous and docking manuevers in space.
                    Find out more about the project
                    <a href='http://spacecraftresearch.squarespace.com/pan' target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p>My job on this team is to engineer the control systems software and hardware that will be responsible for
                    coordinating these manuevers. Using C++, I will be interfacing a Teensy 3.5, our central microcontroller,
                    with the various system peripherals and sensors that will be installed on the spacecraft in order to
                    determine the spacecraft's state. </p>

                <h4>Control Moment Gyroscope Polyhedral Rover</h4>
                <p>This was a former project under the
                    <a href="http://spacecraftresearch.squarespace.com" target="_blank">Space Systems Design Studio</a> headed by Dr. Mason Peck. Using the unique properties of control moment
                    gyroscopes (CMGs), the goal of this project was to design and demonstrate the feasibility of a CMG-based
                    rover.</p>
                <p>I was scheduled to be the team lead of this project in Fall 2018. Unfortunately, due to funding and other
                    constraints, this project was cancelled. While the team was still in existence, I was in charge of the
                    electrical systems and software architecture, and was also responsible for coordinating design and development
                    between the electrical and mechanical subteams.</p>

                <p>As part of a high school internship program, I interned at the lab during Spring 2017. I worked in the Science
                    Education and Public Outreach department of the lab, where my work focused on making nuclear fusion accessible
                    to the public. This included making computational simulations of nuclear physics concepts using Javascript
                    (in particular, using the PIXI.JS framework.)</p>

                <p>At this research program I attended in Summer 2016, I engaged in a unique educational program where the curriculum
                    I chose spanned SOLIDWORKS training, spacecraft design, and a robotics research project.</p>
                <p>The research project was by far the most time-consuming, and also the most fun, aspect of the program. My
                    team's goal was to create a versatile all-terrain rover by modifying a 4-wheeled rover design to include
                    6 linear actuators on each wheel. You can read more about my team's work

                    place nationally.</p>
                <p>In addition, I competed in individual science competitions as well, becoming a semifinalist in the USA Biology

                <h4>Hackathon Projects</h4>
                <p>In high school and college I competed in several hackthons, such as PennApps, HackRPI, HackRU, and BigRedHacks.
                    Through hackathons I developed experience in areas such as electrical engineering, computer vision, and
                    mobile app development.</p>
                <p>During PennApps 2016, my partner Kevin Li and I developed an app called EarLens, a hearing assistance app,
                    that was recognized as a semifinalist (top 15) at the competition. This was among nearly 2000 participants,
                    of mostly college age, while I was a high school junior.</p>

                    are information security/hacking competitions where the objective is to obtain a string, called a flag,
                    by cracking into cryptographic schemes or programs or websites. The team that collects the most number
                    of strings out of a series of uniquely designed challenges wins the CTF tournament.</p>
                <p>Our team placed well in several nationwide competitions, such as 3rd place in
                    <a href="http://hsctf.io" target="_blank">HSCTF</a> 2015 and 2nd place in
